What are signals?
=> Signals are tokens delivered to running processes to indicate a desired action. Using
   signals. Using signals, we can tell a program that we want it to pause or terminate. We

   to send these signals lets us interact with processess and have more control over how 
   they behave. Ex_ ping command
