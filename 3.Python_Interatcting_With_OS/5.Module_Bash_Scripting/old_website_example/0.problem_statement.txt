Imagine that you're migrating your company's website from one web server software
to another. Your web content is stored in a bunch of files that all end in 
uppercase HTM, and the new software requires that they all end in lowercase HTML,
disaster. You can manually rename them one by one using the MV command, but that
could get really old really fast. You'd likely end up making mistakes after the
first few commands. Instead, you could do the same thing with a short Bash script.
