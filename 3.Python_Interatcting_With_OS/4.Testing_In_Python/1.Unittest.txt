# Unittest #

A unittest provides developers with a set of tools to construct and run tests. 
These tests can be run on individual components or by isolating units of code to
ensure their correctness.

=> Concepts

Unittest relies on the following concepts:

1.Test fixture: This refers to preparing to perform one or more tests. In 
addition, test fixtures also include any actions involved in testing cleanup.
This could involve creating temporary or proxy databases, directories, or 
starting a server process.

2.Test case: This is the individual unit of testing that looks for a specific
response to a set of inputs. If needed, TestCase is a base class provided by
unittest and can be used to create new test cases.

3.Test suite: This is a collection of test cases, test suites, or a combination
of both. It is used to compile tests that should be executed together.

4.Test runner: This runs the test and provides developers with the outcomeâ€™s
data.The test runner can use different interfaces, like graphical or textual,
to provide the developer with the test results. It can also provide a special
value to developers to communicate the test results.
