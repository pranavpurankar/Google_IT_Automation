Software testing is a process of evaluating computer code to determine whether or
not it does what you expect it to do. When you test a piece of software, you want
to find the errors and defects and see where things go wrong. Software testing is
similar in lots of ways to the tests performed in the manufacturing process of a 
new piece of machinery.

Manual Testing and Automated Testing

# Manual Testing:
	Executing a script with different command-line arguments to see how its 
	behavior changed is an example of manual testing.
	Using the interpreter to try our code before putting it in a script is 
	another form of manual testing. 
# Atuomated Testing:	
	Formal software testing takes this process a step further, codifying tests
	into its own software and code that can be run to verify that our programs
	do what we expect them to do. This is called automatic testing.

	The goal of automatic testing is to automate the process of checking if the
	returned value matches the expectations.

Instead of us humans running a function over and over with different parameters and checking the results are what we expected them to be, we let the computer do this for us. Automatic testing means we'll write code to do the test.
