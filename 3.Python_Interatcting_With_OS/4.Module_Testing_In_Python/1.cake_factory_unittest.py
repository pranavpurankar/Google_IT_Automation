Refer 1.cake_factory_class.py

Now it’s time to define the unittest methods to test the different functions of the code.
The test suite includes tests for the cake’s flavor, size, toppings, ingredients, and price.The first test case in the suite will intentionally provide the wrong value—and that’s what
we want! Create specific statements to make sure the program is behaving as it should. That
includes providing incorrect data to determine if the program will provide failed results. 
Because unittest is class-based,  encapsulate these statements into test methods.
